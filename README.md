# joke-generator-python
This repository is for the joke generator made in Python.

ProjectLog[0] - The idea for this project is simple, the user will be asked for the permission to move forward with the program, if permission is granted, the user will be asked for the language and the category. I have ideas for a random joke too, i'll implement it later after the first working version of the program is up and ready. </br>
